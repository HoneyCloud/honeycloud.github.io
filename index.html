          <p style="font-size: 16px">
            With the wide adoption, Linux-based IoT devices have emerged as one primary target of
            today’s cyber attacks. While traditional malware-based attacks (e.g., Mirai) can quickly
            spread across these devices, they are well-understood threats with defense techniques
            such as malware fingerprinting coupled with community-based fingerprint sharing.
            Recently, fileless attacks—attacks that do not rely on malware files—have been increasingly
            occurring on Linux-based IoT devices. Such attacks pose significant threats to the security
            and privacy of IoT systems; however, little has been known in terms of their characteristics
            and attack vectors, which hinders research and development efforts to defend against them.
            <br><br>
            In this study, we present our endeavor in understanding fileless attacks on Linux-based
            IoT devices in the wild. Over a span of 12 months, we deployed four hardware IoT honeypots
            and 108 specially designed software IoT honeypots, which successfully attracted a wide
            variety of real-world IoT attacks. We present our measurement study on these attacks, with a
            focus on fileless attacks, including the prevalence, exploits, environments, and impacts.
            Our study further leads to multi-fold insights towards actionable defense strategies which can
            be adopted by IoT vendors and end users.
